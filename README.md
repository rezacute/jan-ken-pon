「ジャンケンポン」 (Jankenpon) is the Japanese name for the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, which is used for decision-making or as a casual game in Japan. Here’s a detailed explanation:

# Basic Rules

	1.	Players: At least two participants.
	2.	Gestures: Each player simultaneously throws one of three hand gestures:
	•	グー (Guu): Rock (a fist).
	•	チョキ (Choki): Scissors (index and middle finger extended).
	•	パー (Paa): Paper (an open hand).
	3.	Outcome:
	•	Rock beats Scissors.
	•	Scissors beat Paper.
	•	Paper beats Rock.
	•	If both players choose the same gesture, it’s a tie, and the game is replayed.

# Chanting Sequence

## The game is accompanied by a rhythmic chant:
	1.	じゃんけんぽん (Jankenpon): The players say this phrase together, synchronizing their gestures to “ポン (pon).”
	2.	あいこでしょ (Aiko desho): If there’s a tie, this phrase means “It’s a tie, isn’t it?” and signals a rematch.
	3.	勝った！(Katta!): The winner may exclaim this, meaning “I won!”


A fun game based on the [Fingerpose gesture detection library](https://github.com/andypotato/fingerpose).
